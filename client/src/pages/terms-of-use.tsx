By accessing or interacting with the Platform—whether as a parent, student, provider, or other visitor—you agree to these Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Use (“TOU”). If you act on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that entity and that it accepts these TOU. If you disagree with any part of the TOU, do not use the Platform.</p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We may update the TOU at our sole discretion. Your continued use of the Platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised TOU. Our Privacy Policy, Posting Guidelines, and other policies referenced here are incorporated by reference and equally binding.</p>

All rights not expressly granted are reserved. You may not reproduce, frame, sell, sublicense, or create derivative works from Platform content except for materials you yourself post.</p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">When you post text, reviews, images, or other content, you grant EYP a worldwide, royalty‑free, irrevocable, sublicensable license to use, display, distribute, and adapt that content in connection with the Platform.</p>

If a provision is unenforceable, it shall be limited or replaced to reflect the parties’ intent while remaining enforceable. Our failure to enforce any right is not a waiver. Sections pertaining to Intellectual&nbsp;Property, Disclaimer, Limitation&nbsp;of&nbsp;Liability, and Indemnity survive termination of these TOU.</p>
