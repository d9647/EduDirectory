give me steps and suggestion what will you do: (1) In user profile, let user set nickname (on top of firstname, lastname). 2) Contribution badges, counts of # numbers of listing added, # numbers of reviews given. New users has "new" user icon on them. How would you design?

Absolutely! Here’s a step-by-step plan and design suggestions for both features:
1. Let Users Set a Nickname in Their Profile
Steps:
Database Update
Add a nickname column to your users table (type: varchar, nullable).
Backend API
Update user profile endpoints to accept and return nickname.
Validate nickname (length, allowed characters, uniqueness if required).
Frontend: Profile Page
Add a new input field labeled “Nickname (optional)” above or near first/last name.
Show a preview of how their name will appear.
Save nickname on profile update.
Display Logic
Use the display logic described earlier: nickname > first+last > first > last > “Anonymous”.
2. Contribution Badges & Counts
Steps:
Database
Ensure each listing/review stores the user_id of its creator.
Optionally, add a created_at field to users for “new” user logic.
Backend
Add endpoints or extend user profile API to return:
Number of listings added.
Number of reviews given.
User’s join date.
Frontend: Profile & Listings
Profile Page:
Show badges for “Top Contributor”, “New User”, etc.
Display counts: “Listings added: 5”, “Reviews given: 2”.
Listing Cards:
Show a small badge or icon next to the contributor’s name (e.g., “New” for new users, “Top” for top contributors).
Badge Logic
“New” User:
If created_at is within last 7/14/30 days, show a “New” badge/icon.
Contribution Badges:
E.g., “Bronze” for 1+, “Silver” for 10+, “Gold” for 50+ listings/reviews.
Tooltip:
On hover, show what the badge means.
