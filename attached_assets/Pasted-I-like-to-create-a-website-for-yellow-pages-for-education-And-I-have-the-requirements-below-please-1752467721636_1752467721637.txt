I like to create a website for yellow pages for education. And I have the requirements below, please suggest overall architecture and show steps by steps to set up such website.

The website has simplicity and minimalist design. We have four main pages:
Tutoring Providers / Business Services Provider 
Summer Camps Opportunities
Internship Opportunities
Jobs Opportunities
All pages have the same design / UI / styles, which list the items with paging options: 5, 10, 25, or 50 items on a page.
We’ll have Filter / Search on the left panel, it is like the Amazon website, for users to filter output to certain tags.
We’ll have a global text search feature enabled as well on the left panel
Output / results will be displayed in table format on the right panel, which is much wider than the left panel, and the sorting is enabled for certain columns.
Every listing displayed will have: Name, Numbers of Thumbs Up, Number of Reviews & ratings (Link to display the reviews provided by users), Website, Categories / Tags, Location, and very short description are shown (will not be full description). Hide the Contact information. User can click on it to see the full information on that listing.
